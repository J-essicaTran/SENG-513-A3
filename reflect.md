# Learned:
- Learned how to use the HTML5 canvas and JavaScript to create a simple game
- Gained knowledge about event listeners and handling user input for game controls
- Developed an understanding of sprite animation and basic game physics

# Challenges:
- Managing input from two players concurrently
- Implementing sprite animations based on user input
- Handling collisions between game objects
- Cutscene transitions

# Game's Complexity:
- Managed the complexity of the game by organizing code into distinct classes (e.g., Cat1, Cat2, Gem, etc.)
- Implemented a custom algorithm (updateGemLocation) to handle the randomization of gem locations over time, adding an additional layer of complexity to the game logic

# Comparison with Initial Design:
- The final product closely aligns with the initial design, which included two cats controlled by different sets of keys and gems that appear randomly on the screen
- The scene transitions, collision detection, randomize gem location, and gem collection mechanisms were successfully implemented as planned
